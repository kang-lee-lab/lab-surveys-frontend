                    Kang Lee Lab has conducted research in a variety of areas including:
                    deception in children and adults, racial bias, bias reduction in
                    children, and fraud among senior citizens. Our studies have also
                    focused on understanding brain development and brain processes of
                    infants and adults using neuroimaging technology called functional
                    Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). We have also conducted research
                    using transdermal optical imaging technology to measure physiological
                    changes such as heart rate and blood pressure from a person's face.
