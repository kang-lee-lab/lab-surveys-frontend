    "description": "This applet computes an individuals likelihood of MMPI. Based on 100 questions, this app uses a machine learning model to compute the likelihood of MMP.<br>Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) is the most widely used psychometric test in the world. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of using a reduced number of questions to predict the status in each conditions accurately.<br>We obtained a dataset of MMPI-2 responses from the Beijing Anding Hospital. The original dataset contains anonymized information on the participants including their demographics (age, sex, etc.), the raw scores and T-scores to each of the conditions, and the answers to each of the questions from the MMPI-2 test from each participant. The information of the participants includes their serial number, age, and their lname. The responses to the questions are \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d, or \u201cMaybe\u201d.<br>We identified the top 100 questions for predicting the ten MMPI conditions, which achieved at least 85% area under curve (AUC ROC) for predicting each of the conditions.<br>Our findings suggest that machine learning models using reduced number of questions are capable of making accurate assessment for MMPI.",
