# lab-surveys-frontend

A prototype of the current Kang Lee Lab Surveys front-end but redeveloped in the React.js framework.

## Running locally

To run locally open Visual Studio Code and clone the repository.

In the terminal, open the repository and run `npm install` to install all required node modules to run the project.

Once that is finished, run `npm start` in the terminal which will start a local server on `localhost:3000`
