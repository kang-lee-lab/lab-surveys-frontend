# lab-surveys-frontend

A prototype of the current Kang Lee Lab Surveys front-end but redeveloped in the React.js framework. Currently hosted on [Heroku](https://kangleelab-surveys-qa-ae98ac8adddf.herokuapp.com/) on the QA environment.

## Running locally

To run locally open Visual Studio Code and clone the repository.

Make sure you have at least Node version of v14.16.1 or higher.

In the terminal, open the repository and run `npm install` to install all required node modules to run the project.

Once that is finished, run `npm start` in the terminal which will start a local server on `localhost:3000`

## Development

Please download the 'Prettier - Code formatter' extension on VSCode so we can keep our formatting consistent. This also reduces conflicts when committing code since it'll adjust spacing, tabbing, etc for us.
